  year     = {2014},
  abstract = {– CABRI is an experimental pulse reactor operated by CEA at the Cadarache research center. Since
1978 the experimental programmes have aimed at studying the fuel behaviour under Reactivity Initiated 
Accident (RIA) conditions. At the centre of the CABRI driver core, an experimental loop was designed to 
accommodate the instrumented test device that contains the fuel rod to be tested, and to cool this fuel rod into the 
required thermal-hydraulic conditions. 
For past FBR’s fuels studies, a sodium experimental loop was used. In order to study the PWR high burn up fuel 
behavior, the facility was modified in order to have a water loop able to provide thermal-hydraulic conditions 
representative of the nominal operating PWR’s ones (155 bar, 300°C). This project which began in 2003 lied 
within a broader scope including an overall facility refurbishment and a safety review. The global modification is 
conducted by the CEA project team. It is funded by IRSN1, which is conducting the CIP experimental program, 
in the framework of the OECD/NEA project CIP. 
In the framework of the reactor restart, commissioning tests are realized for all equipments, systems and circuits 
of the reactor. 
This paper focuses on the renovation, the improvement and the experimental validation of the Cabri 3He 
transient rods system. This system controls the very fast depressurization of tubes (so called transient rods), 
located among the Cabri core fuel rods, filled of 3He (strong neutron absorber) into a discharge tank. The rapid 
absorber depressurization leads the tested fuel rod to be submitted to the desired power transient. 
The 3He transient rods system requalification tests were performed from 2012 to 2013. They allowed validating 
the good functioning of the system (instrumentation, circuits, valves…) and of the new 3He fast-opening valves 
control device. In addition, the zeolite trapping operation performed on the 1000l volume of 3He stored since 
2003 allowed getting very convenient final 3He purity.},

Using an experimental TREAT critical measurement and a transient for a small, simplified core, Rattlesnake and MAMMOTH simulations are performed building from simple infinite media to a full core model. Cross section processing methods are evaluated, various homogenization approaches are assessed and the neutronic behavior of the core studied to determine key modeling aspects. The simulation of the minimum critical core with the diffusion solver shows very good agreement with the reference Monte Carlo simulation and the experiment. The full core transient simulation with thermal feedback shows a significantly lower power peak compared to the documented experimental measurement, which is not unexpected in the early stages of model development. For this reason, a sensitivity analysis to the adiabatic model and the magnitude of the reactivity insertion are included.},

  abstract = {Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary means to assess accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V&V in production and commercial software.},

  abstract = {The restart of the TRansient REactor Test (TREAT) facility combined with the shutdown of the Halden 
reactor in Norway lead to an increased interest in mimicking Reactivity Initiated Accident (RIA) events 
conditions for Light Water Reactor within TREAT itself. One of the engineering challenges for this task is 
to increase the energy deposition rate on the tested fuel element by shortening the width of the power burst 
from its current 89 msec down to 40 msec. One of the options proposed by Idaho National Laboratory 
consists of pressurizing rapidly a specially designed hollow control rod with Helium-3. The insertion of 
negative reactivity in the form of Helium-3, a strong neutron absorber, must be well predicted and 
repeatable. In this prospect, an out-of-pile prototype, the Helium Negative Reactivity Insertion (HENRI) 
facility, has been designed and built at Oregon State University to assess the feasibility, the repeatability 
and the control of such process. Tests have been performed to assess the effect of the driving pressure and 
the minimum opening area. These tests, although performed with rupture disks, helped shed light on the 
physics occurring in the system and gain confidence in the predictability of the helium density evolution. 
The latter is critical to characterize properly the effect of the Helium-3 injection on the overall core 
reactivity.},

Establishing the credibility of a computational model to assess performance is important because of the potential risk a device presents to patients and/or healthcare providers.

Model credibility can be established through verification and validation (V\&V) activities. Although methods for V\&V are becoming well established, guidance is lacking on assessing the relecance and adequacy of the V\&V activities for computational models used to support medical device development and evaluation. Given the inherent risk of using a computational model as a basis for predicting medical device performance, the ASME V\&V 40 Subcommittee has developed a risk-informed credibility assessment framework. The framework centers on establishing that model credibility is commensurate with the risk associated with the decisions influenced by the computational model. Thus, the intent of this Standard is to provide guidance on how to establish and communicate risk-informed credibility of computational models used in the evaluation of medical devices.},

  abstract = {The Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility provided thousands of transient irradiations and plays a crucial role in nuclear-heated safety research. The facility’s flexible design and multi-mission nature saw historic experiments for numerous reactor fuels and transient types but was never specifically adapted to address very-brief pulse transients akin to postulated Light Water Reactor (LWR) Reactivity Initiated Accidents (RIA). Since the behaviors of fuel under these conditions depends strongly on energy input duration and resulting cladding time/temperature response under pellet cladding mechanical interactions, this three-year project was conceived to investigate new pulse-narrowing capabilities. Kinetic models showed incremental improvements for minor facility enhancements including increased reactivity step insertions (to initiate the power pulse) and slightly-increased transient rod drive speed for pulse termination (“clipping”). Replacing peak fuel assemblies, repositioning non-transient control rods to hold down the “hot side” of the core, and balancing against required excess reactivity needs, the limiting fuel assembly power can be reduced by ∼20\%. This is a remarkable discovery of latent capability in TREAT, not only in enabling the subject capabilities for reduced pulse widths, but also significantly “uprating” the core’s transient energy capacity. Incremental improvements can likely enhance TREAT’s capability into BWR-relevant missions; briefer PWR pulse shapes can only be achieved with an advanced clipping system. Helium-3 (3He) was found to offer the greatest benefits for clipping design and overall performance. A unique concept showed great promise for enabling a 3He-based system with a reasonable cost; this design concept will likely become the focal point of future work.},

The advantages and disadvantages of each facility are presented and discussed by comparing the design and capabilities across nuclear transient reactor facilities (TRF). Further, a discussion of a specific IEV from each TRF shows the operational similarities and differences across TRFs. This comparison shows how some TRF designs are best suited for specific research areas and how others are being re-designed with flexible capabilities in mind. This inventory and comparison of global nuclear transient testing capabilities provides insight into the history, current status and future of nuclear fuel and technology development.},

  abstract  = {Pulse generated in the Transient Reactor Test facility at Idaho National Laboratory can reach a minimum 
full width at half maximum of 100 ms. for a maximum power of 5500 MW with the current configuration. 
To reproduce conditions of a Reactivity Insertion Accident postulated for Light Water Reactor, the width 
of the pulse shall decrease down below 50 ms. to increase even more the maximum power. To reach this 
goal, it is intended to initiate higher power transient that could quickly be clipped to maintain the total 
energy deposition within the 2500 MJ limit of the reactor operation license. One of the pulse clipping 
options under consideration is the implementation of a fast-negative reactivity insertion system by injecting 
helium 3 in the core. Initial calculation shows that to ensure fast clipping of the pulse, the new system, in a 
form of a cartridge pre-inserted in the core, shall undergo a quick pressurization from near vacuum to 
minimum density of 2.2 kg/m3 in less than 5 ms. The HENRI (Helium 3 Negative Reactivity Insertion) 
facility has been designed and built at the Oregon State University to test the feasibility of such system, 
design a fast response pressurization system and test the repeatability of the process. To support this task, 
preliminary CFD calculations are performed. In this first stage of the project, only the gas dynamics part of 
the process is considered. Initial results show that the ultimate atomic density could physically be reached 
within the 5 ms. limit assuming an ultra-fast opening device.},

Cross section processing methods are evaluated, various homogenization approaches are assessed and the neutronic behavior of the core studied to determine key modeling aspects.  The simulation of the minimum critical core with the diffusion solver shows very good agreement with the reference Monte Carlo simulation and the experiment. The full core transient simulation with thermal feedback shows a significantly lower power peak compared to the documented experimental measurement, which is not unexpected in the early stages of model development. For this reason, a sensitivity analysis to the adiabatic model and the magnitude of the reactivity insertion are included.},

  abstract = {The testing of nuclear fuel under reactivity-initiated accident (RIA) conditions is paramount for the better understanding of the fuel's behavior during this transient accident events. The Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) facility is a nuclear reactor that will be capable of recreating the thermal-hydraulic and neutronic boundary conditions representative of RIA events for light water reactors (LWRs). However, one of the engineering challenges to perform such fuel tests is to increase the energy deposition on the fuel sample by reducing the current TREAT's pulse width of 89 down to 40 ms. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) proposed to clip the pulse by inserting helium-3, a strong neutron absorber, into an annular control rod using a gas injection system known as the Helium-3 Enhanced Negative Reactivity (HENRI) facility. The purpose of this study is to pave the path towards the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model capable of confidently simulate the density evolution inside of the HENRI facility using the commercial CFD software STAR-CCM+. The development of a CFD model is essential since existing instrumentation is unable to obtain a direct measurement of the helium density, and indirect methods are unable to measure it with high accuracy. For better analysis of the system's performance inside of the TREAT facility, the CFD model will be coupled with a reactor physics modeling software so a more representative analysis of the transient pulse of the TREAT can be obtained.},

The third unit of the Ringhals nuclear power plant comprises a 3-loop Westinghouse design pressurized water reactor on the Swedish West Coast. At first, the development of the PARCS and RELAP5 models are presented. On the neutronic side, a unique cross-section interface, allowing feeding PARCS with realistic data, was developed. The dependence of the material constants on history effects, burnup, and instantaneous conditions is accounted for, and the full heterogeneity of the core is thus taken into account. The reflectors are also explicitly represented. On the thermal-hydraulic side, all the 157 fuel assemblies are modeled individually in the code input. The model is furthermore able to handle possible asymmetrical conditions of the flow velocity and temperature fields between the loops. The coupling between the two codes is touched upon, with emphasis on the mapping between the hydrodynamic/heat structures and the neutronic nodes. Comparison between calculated and measured parameters demonstrates that the coupled model is able to correctly represent the steady-state conditions of the plant. The validation of the coupled model against measured transient plant data is then performed. It is demonstrated that the coupled model is able to catch the main features of the transient with a sufficient level of accuracy.},

  abstract = {Efforts to develop high-fidelity, in silico or ab initio, high performance multi-physics tools are undertaken by many groups due to the availability of relatively cheap, large-scale parallel computers. To this end, an internal coupling between the Monte Carlo reactor physics code Serpent 2 and the sub-channel code SUBCHANFLOW has been developed. The coupled code system is intended to serve as reference for deterministic reactor dynamics code developments in the future. It exploits the fact that Serpent was conceived as a lattice code for such deterministic tools. The coupling utilizes Serpent’s recently introduced universal multi-physics interface. With the multi-physics interface enabled, Serpent treats temperature dependence of nuclear data using the target motion sampling method. Since the target motion sampling methodology cannot be applied to thermal bound-atom scattering or unresolved resonances, a stochastic mixing fall back algorithm to enable the simulation of thermal reactors has been implemented. The developed coupled code is verified by code-to-code comparison with an external coupling of the Monte Carlo tool TRIPOLI4 and SUBCHANFLOW as well as the internally coupled code MCNP5/SUBCHANFLOW. Simulation results of all code systems were found to be in good agreement. Thereafter, the second exercise of the OECD/NEA and U.S. NRC PWR MOX/UO2 core transient benchmark is studied to demonstrate that Serpent 2/SUBCHANFLOW may be employed to analyze realistic, industry-like cases such as a full PWR core under hot full power conditions in a reasonable amount of time. The obtained simulation results are compared to known benchmark solutions and the numerical performance of Serpent 2/SUBCHANFLOW is analyzed to assess the feasibility of routine application. While Serpent 2/SUBCHANFLOW’s performance in terms of physics and numerical efficiency is found to be generally satisfactory, options to further improve the coupled tool concerning both aspects are discussed. Afterwards, first efforts to validate Serpent 2/SUBCHANFLOW using the hot zero power state of the cycle 1 of the BEAVRS benchmark are presented.},

  abstract = {A new method for calculating power shape and critical control rod position is described and validated in view of increasing the fidelity of the Penn State Breazeale Reactor's (PSBR) fuel management code. Currently, the PSBR fuel management code is biased against experimental results and requires the use of empirical correction factors. This is likely due to a combination of assumptions, such as the control rods being fixed in the all-out position and the use of a uniform fuel temperature. The proposed method supplies this data using fission-matrix-based neutronics coupled with TRACE thermal-hydraulics. The fission-matrix-based neutronics relies on Serpent for precalculation of fission matrices. Steady-state fuel temperature distributions, power shapes, and control rod positions are calculated through iteration between TRACE and fission matrix calculations. Validation is performed on the coupled TRACE-fission matrix model for powers ranging from 50 kW to 1 MW. For these cases, the RMS average error with experimental data is 12.7 K for instrumented element fuel temperature and $0.07 for reactivity change. Agreement is generally within estimated experimental uncertainty. The effect of various modeling parameters, such as the fuel-cladding gap heat transfer coefficient and the exact radial location of the instrumented element thermocouple, are shown. Finally, the impact of this increased modeling fidelity on the depletion calculation is estimated. In the future, this validation should be repeated on later core loadings of the PSBR where more detailed experimental data is available. Comparison between the current PSBR fuel management code and the proposed model should also be made.},

The SPERT III E-core was a thermal research reactor constructed to analyze reactor dynamics. Its configuration resembles a commercial PWR on terms of fuel type, choice of moderator, coolant flow and system pressure. The initial conditions of the rod ejection accident experiments (REA) performed cover cold startup, hot startup, hot standby and operating power scenarios. Eight of these experiments were analyzed in detail. Firstly, multi-dimensional nodal diffusion cross section tables were created for the three-dimensional reactor simulator DYNSUB employing the Monte Carlo neutron transport code Serpent 2. In a second step, DYNSUB stationary simulations were compared to Monte Carlo reference three-dimensional full scale solutions obtained with Serpent 2 (cold startup conditions) and Serpent 2/SUBCHANFLOW (operating power conditions) with a good agreement being observed. The latter tool is an internal coupling of Serpent 2 and the sub-channel thermal-hydraulics code SUBCHANFLOW. Finally, DYNSUB was utilized to study the eight selected transient experiments. Results were found to match measurements well. As the selected experiments cover much of the possible transient (delayed super-critical, prompt super-critical and super-prompt critical excursion) and initial conditions (cold and hot as well as zero, little and full power reactor states) one expects in commercial PWRs, the obtained results give confidence that the Serpent 2-DYNSUB tool chain is suitable to model REAs and other RIAs in PWRs.},

  abstract     = {This paper demonstrates the applicability of Monte Carlo analysis to perform nuclear reactor core simulations with thermofluid feedback from a computational fluid dynamics code. An interface program, McSTAR, was written to couple MCNP5 to the commercial computational fluid dynamics code STAR-CD. McStar is a Perl script which alternately executes MCNP5, STAR-CD and cross section update routines on multiprocessor Linux clusters. It also performs the necessary manipulations in the MCNP5 input and data files. Cross section libraries are generated using the sub-pin level temperature distribution calculated by STAR-CD, and MCNP input files are manipulated to reflect the moderator density distribution provided by STAR-CD. Using this feedback data, the MCNP simulation proceeds and determines the next approximation for the eigenvalue as well as the heat source distribution for the next CFD calculation. Several methods to update cross section library were investigated and are described in the paper. The coupled codes were tested using a single PWR pin-cell problem and 3x3 array of PWR fuel pins. The preliminary results are compared with those obtained from a STAR-CD calculation coupled with the deterministic transport code DeCART. Ongoing research is described to investigate more efficient acceleration and convergence methods, as well as more robust methods to validate the coupled calculation.},

  abstract     = {Computational modeling can be used throughout the product life cycle to provide information about technical performance, safety, and effectiveness of medical devices. Computational models can also be used to assess aspects of in vivo performance without subjecting patients (or animals) topotential harm or unnecessary risk. Establishing the credibility of a computational model to assess performance is important because of the potential risk a device presents to patients and/or healthcare providers.

Model credibility can be established through verification and validation (V\&V) activities. Although methods for V\&V are becoming well established, guidance is lacking on assessing the relecance and adequacy of the V\&V activities for computational models used to support medical device development and evaluation. Given the inherent risk of using a computational model as a basis for predicting medical device performance, the ASME V\&V 40 Subcommittee has developed a risk-informed credibility assessment framework. The framework centers on establishing that model credibility is commensurate with the risk associated with the decisions influenced by the computational model. Thus, the intent of this Standard is to provide guidance on how to establish and communicate risk-informed credibility of computational models used in the evaluation of medical devices.},

  abstractnote = {TREAT is an air-cooled, graphite moderated, thermal, heterogeneous test facility designed to evaluate reactor fuels and structural materials under conditions simulating various types of nuclear excursions and transient undercooling situations that could occur in a nuclear reactor. After 21 years in a standby mode, TREAT is being re-activated to revive transient testing capabilities. Given the time elapsed and the concurrent loss of operating experience, current generation and advanced computational methods are being applied to begin TREAT modeling and simulation prior to renewed at-power operations. Such methods have limited value in predicting the behavior of TREAT without proper validation. Hence, the U.S. DOE has developed a number of programs to support development of benchmarks for both critical and transient operations. Extensive effort has been expended at INL to collect detailed descriptions, drawings and specifications for all aspects of TREAT, and to resolve conflicting data found through this process. This report provides a collection of these data, with updated figures that are significantly more readable than historic drawings and illustrations, compositions, and dimensions based on the best available sources. This document is not nor should it be considered to be a benchmark report. Rather, it is intended to provide one-stop shopping, to the extent possible, for other work that seeks to prepare detailed, accurate models of the core and its components. Given the nature of the variety of historic documents available and the loss of institutional memory, the only completely accurate database of TREAT data is TREAT itself. Unfortunately, disassembly of TREAT for inspection, assay, and measurement is highly unlikely. Hence the data provided herein is intended serve as a best-estimate substitute.},
